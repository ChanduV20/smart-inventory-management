# Smart-Inventory-Management 

### Week 1 : Core JavaScript (for React)
- ### DAY1
  - [ ] Use let vs const correctly 
  - [ ] Write arrow functions 
  - [ ] Practice destructing(objects & Arrays)
  - [ ] Use spread operator on : Arrays & Objects 
  - [ ] Write pure functions
  
  ### Practice
    - [ ] Function to caluculate days left till expiry 
    - [ ] Function to mark item as expired (immutable update)
  ---
- ### DAY 2 : Arrays & Logic (React Depends on this)
    Master array methods & Logic operations 
    - [ ] Use map() to transform arrays 
    - [ ] Use filter() to remove items 
    - [ ] Use reduce() for totals 
    - [ ] Sort items by expiry date 
    - [ ] Assign color based on days left 
    ### Practice Task 
    - [ ] Given a list of items 
      - [ ] Sort by nearest expiry 
      - [ ] Attach color (red/orange/green)

- ### DAY 3 : Async Javascript (Real App behavior)
    Understand asynchronous data flow . 
    - [ ] Understand promises 
    - [ ] Write async/await 
    - [ ] Use try/Catch 
    - [ ] Simulate API call using setTimeout 
  
  ### Practice Task 
    - [ ] Fake API : 
      - [ ] Fetch Inventory after 2 seconds 
      - [ ] show loading state 
      - [ ] Handle error state 
  <hr> 
- ### DAY 4 : React Core Concepts(Mental shift) 
    Understand how React builds UI from data . 
    - [ ] Create functional components 
    - [ ] Use JSX correctly 
    - [ ] Pass props parent -> Child 
    - [ ] Use useState
    - [ ] Render list using map() 
    - [ ] conditional rendering 
    ### Practice Task 
    - [ ] Inventory list components
    - [ ] Item card component 
    - [ ] Show "No items " when empty 

<hr>

- ### DAY 5 : State & Data Flow (Critical)
  Think in state-drive UI 
  - [ ] Difference between normal variable & state
  - [ ] Update state immutably 
  - [ ] Handle button click -> state update
  - [ ] Remoe item using state update
  - [ ] Understand re-render tirgger 
  ### Practice Task 
  - [ ] Add item button 
  - [ ] Delete item button 
  - [ ] UI updates constantly 

---

- ### DAY 6 : Mini project (Apply Everything)
   Build Inventory Prototype V1
  - [ ] Hardcoded inventory data 
  - [ ] Render list using Flatlist / map 
  - [ ] Color - coded expiry 
  - [ ] Add item 
  - [ ] Delete item 
  - [ ] Sort by Expiry 
   ### Bonus (optional)
   - [ ] Empty state UI 
   - [ ] Simple styling 

--- 

- ### DAY 7 Review & Strengthen 
  Consolidate learning 
  - [ ] Refactor messy code 
  - [ ] Rename variables clearly 
  - [ ] Remove unused state 
  - [ ] Add comments where logic is non-obvious 
  - [ ] Explain code aloud(important)
  
- ### Self Check Questions 
  - [ ] Why state causes re-render ? 
  - [ ] Why spread operator is needed ? 
  - [ ] Why keys are required ? 
  - [ ] What happens if state is mutated ?
